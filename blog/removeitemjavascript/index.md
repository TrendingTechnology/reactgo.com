JavaScript offers us different methods to remove the items/elements from the array today we are going to learn about the pop method and shift method.

###Pop method

The pop method helps us to remove the last item from the array and returns the removed item.

```js
const arr = [1,2,3,4]
console.log(arr.pop()) //output  4
console.log(arr) //output  [1,2,3]
```

### Shift method

The shift method helps us to remove the first item from the array and returns that removed item.

```js
const arr = [1,2,3,4]
console.log(arr.shift()) //output  1
console.log(arr) //output  [2,3,4]
```

Happy codingâ€¦
