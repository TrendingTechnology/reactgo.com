In es6, JavaScript introduces a new way to create strings by using template literals where you can also create multiline strings.


To create a template literal, we need to use the backticks syntax `(``)` instead of double or single quotes.



### Multiline strings example

```js


let multi = `This
is a
Multiline
string.
`

```



```js

let name = `this
is
a
big
multiline
string
`

```
