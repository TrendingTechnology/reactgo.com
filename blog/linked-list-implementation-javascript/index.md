In this tutorial, we are going to learn about what is linked list and implementation of singly linked list in JavaScript.

## What is Linked List?

Linked List is a Linear collection of data where each node has a connection to the next node. it is a data structure with a group of nodes are in the sequence.

Linked lists were developed in 1955â€“1956 by Allen Newell, Cliff Shaw and Herbert A. Simon at RAND Corporation as the primary data structure for their Information Processing Language.

### Singly Linked List

A singly Linked list is a collection of nodes where each node has a connection to the next node.

### Algorithm implementation

Let's implement the singly linked list in javascript.

We are using javascript classes if you don't know about classes then please check out my previous tutorial [How classes work in javascript ?](/javascript-class/).




```js
class Node{

  constructor(data){
   this.data = data;
   this.next = null;
 }

}
```

Our Node has two properties which are `data` and `next`.


```js
class SinglyLinkedList{

  constructor(){
    this.head = null;
    this.tail = null;
    this.length= 0;
  }

}
```

 SinglyLinkedList class has three properties

- head: It is the first node in the List.
- tail: Last node in the list.
- length: How many nodes present in the list?


we are implementing our first method.


### Push Method

- Push method takes the one argument and pushes it to the end of the list.
- Each time we need to increment the length property by 1.


```js
class SinglyLinkedList{

  constructor(){
    this.head = null;
    this.tail = null;
    this.length= 0;
  }


  push(data){

    let node = new Node(data)

    if(!this.head){
      // this is our first node so we make head and tail pointing
      // to the same node.
      this.head= node;
      this.tail= node ;
    }else{
      // updating the tail
      this.tail.next = node;
      this.tail = node;
    }
    // increment the node length by 1
    this.length++
  }

}


const list = new SinglyLinkedList();


list.push(3);
list.push(4);
list.push(5);

console.log(list);
```

Output

Have you seen in the above image the tail is pointing to `5` because we pushed `5` at the last.

### Pop method

- The pop method helps us to remove the last node from the linked list
- If we remove the node from the list then we need to decrement the node length
 by 1.


__Pseudocode__

1. if there is no `head` then return `null`.
2. Declare two variables node and deleteNode
  - node: initialize with this.head.
  - deleteNode: currently we treated the first node as deleted Node.

3. If there is single node we assign head and tail to null.
    - decrement length by 1
    - return deleteNode.
4. while loop starts if there is more than one node.

5. decrement length by 1.

```js
  pop(){

    if(!this.head) return null

    let node = this.head;
    let deleteNode = node;

    if(!node.next){
    // single node  so we assign head and tail to null
      this.head= null
      this.tail = null
    }
     //more than 1 node
     while(node.next){
       if(!node.next.next){
        // last node found
          deleteNode=node.next;
          node.next = null;
          this.tail=node;
          break
       }
        node = node.next
     }

    this.length--
    return deleteNode
  }

```



### Get method

Get method helps us to get the node at the particular index.

__Pseudocode__

1. if there is no `head` or `index` is less than 0 or `index` is greater than the `length` then return null.
2. Declare a variable currentNode and initialize to this.head.
3. if the index is greater than 0  While loop starts.
  - update the currentNode.
  - decrement the index by 1.
4. return the currentNode.


```js
get(index){

    if(!this.head || index < 0 || index > this.length-1) return null

     // currentNode is pointing to head
    let currentNode = this.head;

    while(index){
     // updating the currentNode with next node
      currentNode = currentNode.next;
      index--;
    }
    return currentNode;
 }
```
