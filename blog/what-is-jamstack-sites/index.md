Jamstack is the Modern way to build websites by using JavaScript, Apis and Markup.


### Jamstack

__JavaScript__ :  The request and response cycle is handled by the client-side JavaScript it can be your single-page-app(spa) such as react or vuejs or  plain JavaScript.

__Apis__: The APIs are used to store the user data in the database or handling authentication.

__Markup__: Site markup can prebuilt during the build time by using a static site generator.


### Why JAMstack sites are fast?

- There is no heavy lifting servers behind the jamstack sites because everything is prebuilt HTML, CSS,JavaScript and served using the content delivery network(CDN).

- Each time you click on a new page or blog post in the WordPress site we make a network request to the server and we need to wait until the server builds that page and sends back to the client it often sometimes server fail to build a webpage during the heavy load.

- The hosting cost is also very cheap for the Jamstack sites compare to the other tech stacks.(Lamp or mean etc).

- High security.
